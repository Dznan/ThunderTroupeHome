thundertroupe = Thunder Troupe
intro = Members of the Thunder Troupe are from all walks of life. Among them are lawyers, scientists, university professors and financial practitioners, etc. They are a group of people who seek the light within, and their plays explore how this pursuit takes place. They perform without acting, as the lines resonate with their real life. They are playing roles of stories, but they are playing more themselves. What shows on stage is the hardship and transformation that they have genuinely experienced......

totalIntroPart1 = The Thunder Troupe originated in the quest for light, a quest that those who wander the intellectual world went on. Seeking the light is of human nature, and a Buddhist tale reflects such nature. It is said that after obtaining the Gautama Buddha\'\'s teachings, Demon Mara hastened to take leave. He, however, could not depart. Mara found himself surrounded by the infinite darkness of Akasha, with the Buddha being the sole source of light: even Mara could not find his way back home on an unlit path.
totalIntroPart2 = Therefore, one is bound to be unwise and misguided before finding the light. Henry Thoreau expressed a similar view, asserting that \'\"we inhabitants of New England live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate the surface of things.\'\" And how, pray, is the life that we are living different from this \'\"mean life\'\"? What we desperately need at the moment is the discovery of the inner light and the enlightenment of our true selves to elevate our present life to a virtuous one.
totalIntroPart3 = Yet we find ourselves pondering, \'\"Where is the light?\'\" Modern beings seem more used to putting up an exhibit of darkness and depression. In Franz Kafka\'\'s words, people \'\"lived, looked around, and wrote down\'\" the seemingly unbearable situations in life. The ancient culture of the orient nevertheless comforts us by pointing out that the true light is buried deep down in the mortal heart, that \'\"the richest vein is somewhere hereabouts.\'\" The quest for light is a homeward path that guides our gaze away from the material world and inward to the bottoms of our hearts. Thus an untiring seeker of the light cries out: \'\"So by the divining-rod and thin rising vapors I judge; and here I will begin to mine.\'\"
totalIntroPart4 = Then there are us who are in pursuit of the light, the members of the Thunder Troupe. We perform without staging, since we showcase our actual search for light; we play roles without acting, since we present the hardships and transformations that we genuinely experienced.
totalIntroPart5 = In each of our professional life we play the roles of attorneys, bankers, corporate managers, scholars or students. But when we gather on this stage, which none of us are professionally trained for, we play the role of ourselves - the light seekers.

joinUsPart1 = Do you hear the distant thunders? They sing of wisdom from the ancient East. Thunder troupe pursues the light of dawn. If you like to experience the oriental culture via theatre plays, please join us.
joinUsPart2 = The invite is from heart to heart - theatre performing is not only an art form, but more a cry from souls. Dramas on stage are windows through which we demonstrate our uttermost honest views of the world and how far we have travelled inwards - the practice of pursuing wisdom. That said, performing cannot replace the practice itself. We have gained happiness, and even more, we have harvested the inner light through this process - "People who are whole-heartedly devoted to others without any selfish intention will keep a pleasant state of mind. This manifests the blossom of inner light."
joinUsPart3 = We hope that you can feel the light shining out of our heart on stage. We would like to invite you backstage, to experience with us the light emerging from your own heart. Please join us - whether it is to write a play, be an actor, organize an event, or simply be part of the troupe.
